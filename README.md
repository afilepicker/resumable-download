This is to illustrate that chromium blows up on memory usage

To run it (you need to install express). 
```
npm i
```
Running the app will first generate a random 5GiB large file to `public/random.bin` and then open up in a random open port that you can open and test with different browsers

to run
```
node index.js
```
